# ChatApp

This is a small chat application that interacts with a mock API to send and receive messages. It's written using Swift 3, and makes use of Alamofire to handle networking requests with the API. 

To install the application, simply clone and then run "pod install" to install Alamofire.

##Note
To use Alamofire v4.0.1 (compatible with Swift 3), CocoaPods needs to be updated to at least version 1.1.0.
